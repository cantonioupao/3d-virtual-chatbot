# 3d-virtual-chatbot
This is the repository for the master thesis project of a 3D virtual chatbot.
The repository consists of various google colab notebooks that can help you kickstart the project. 
Specifically, it supports a quick plug and play of the following models:
 - [fs_vid2vid](https://github.com/NVlabs/imaginaire/blob/master/projects/fs_vid2vid/README.md) &rarr; open Colab Notebook [here]() (fs_vid2vid_inference.ipynb)
 - [VOCA](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca) &rarr; open Colab Notebook [here]() (voca.ipynb)
 - [DECA](https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA) &rarr; open Colab Notebook [here]() (deca.ipynb)
 
The notebooks allow also, customized testing of the models. This means that any examples of face images or audio sequences can be used for inference or testing.
The novel implementation of an end-to-end Detailed Textured Avatar Enhancer named **DECAthlon** is also included in the repository.

## Getting Started
The Google Colab notebooks have detailed explanations on how ot install and run all models. Please refer to the respective notebooks, or follow the guidelines for a clean local installation (Linux based systems)
